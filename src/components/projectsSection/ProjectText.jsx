  Here is a showcase of some of the projects I have built along my learning journey. Each project reflects my passion for turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly, and visually engaging experiences.
From simple games like <span className="font-bold">Rock-Paper-Scissor</span> to functional applications like a <span className="font-bold">ToDo App</span> and larger projects such as a <span className="font-bold">YouTube Frontend clone</span>, these works highlight my growing expertise in <span className="font-bold">JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS, Frontend, and Backend</span>, as well as <span className="font-bold">problem-solving and implementation</span>.
<br />
With every project, I strive to improveâ€”writing clean code, applying efficient logic, and experimenting with modern design principles.
